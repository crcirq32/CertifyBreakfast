### 1. Definitions and Objectives

#### Threat Hunting
- **Focus**: Discover vulnerabilities in environments, code, networking, operating systems, applications, etc.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Less disruptive: "Look but don’t touch."
  - Based on observation and analysis.
  - Aims to shorten detection time for threats.
  - Primarily identifies weaknesses.

#### Penetration Testing (Pentesting)
- **Focus**: Actively exploits vulnerabilities to demonstrate their existence.
- **Characteristics**:
  - More aggressive and potentially disruptive.
  - May cause system failures (e.g., crashes, buffer overflows).
  - "Let's see how we could be attacked."
  - Validates vulnerabilities through actual exploitation.
  - Provides an external perspective on security (attackers' viewpoint).
  - Enhances organizational security posture and aids in compliance.

### 2. Key Components of Penetration Testing

- **Purpose**: Identify vulnerabilities.
- **Rules of Engagement**: Must be validated before testing begins.
  - **Authorization**: Essential; never proceed without explicit permission.
  - **Time Bound**: Define when and how long the tests will occur.
  - **Scope**: Clearly outline testing parameters; prevent scope creep.
  - **Legality**: Ensure the test complies with local laws.
  - **Types of Testing**: Specify whether it includes web, WLAN, social engineering, etc.
  - **Tools and Techniques**: Clearly define methods and aggressiveness of the approach.
  - **Engagement Types**:
    - **White Box**: Full insider knowledge (simulates insider threat).
    - **Grey Box**: Partial knowledge (simulates regular employee).
    - **Black Box**: No prior knowledge (simulates external attacker).
  - **Staff Involvement**: Necessary for social engineering exercises.
  - **Reporting**: Include lessons learned, findings, and remediation proposals.

### 3. Wargames

Wargames involve organized team-based simulations with specific roles:
- **Red Team**: Attackers using black, grey, or white box approaches (also known as a tiger team).
- **Blue Team**: Incident responders following established procedures and utilizing defensive tools.
- **White Team**: Moderators overseeing the game, ensuring rules of engagement are followed.
- **Purple Team**: Comprised of members from both red and blue teams to facilitate communication and collaboration.

### 4. Active Defense Strategies

Proactive measures taken before and during attacks:
- **Decoy Tactics & Honeypots**:
  - **Honeypots**: Fake servers for monitoring exploitation attempts.
    - Example: OpenCanary (open-source).
  - **Honeynets**: Fake network segments simulating legitimate activity to monitor exploits.
  
- **Annoyance Tactics**: Deliberately misleading information to confuse attackers.
  
- **Counterattacks**: Defensive actions against attackers (e.g., disrupting botnet command and control systems) that do not constitute offensive measures.

### 5. Security Approaches

#### Blacklist/Blocklist Approach
- **Concept**: Specifies what is NOT allowed (e.g., websites, apps, protocols).
- **Applications**: Useful during incident response.
- **Considerations**:
  - Risks of excessive blocking (interfering with legitimate traffic).
  - Insufficient blocking may leave vulnerabilities exposed.

#### Whitelist Approach
- **Concept**: Specifies what is allowed; denies everything else.
- **Efficiency**: More efficient by defining known good entities rather than identifying all potential threats.
- **Considerations**:
  - Requires more administrative work and could restrict users if legitimate services are interrupted.

### 6. Execution Control

Execution control is typically part of endpoint security solutions, focusing on monitoring applications on endpoints.
- **Purpose**: Monitor and govern the installation and execution of applications on endpoints.
- **Approaches**: Can employ whitelist or blacklist strategies.
- **Requirements**: Installation of an agent on the host.
  - **Windows**:
    - Software Restriction Policies (SRP)
    - AppLocker (Windows 10 or 11)
    - Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)
  - **Linux**:
    - AppArmor (Mandatory Access Control)
    - SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) enforcing system-level policies.

### 7. Mobile Device Management

Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) can enforce execution controls on mobile devices, restricting which applications can be downloaded and used.
