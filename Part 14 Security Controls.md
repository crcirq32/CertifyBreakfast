## NIST Categories - Publication 800-53: Security Controls

### 1. Technical Controls

- **Definition**: Software, hardware, or configurations designed to protect against attackers.
- **Examples**:
  - Firewalls
  - Access control systems
  - Proxies
  - Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) (e.g., ModSecurity for Apache, FortiWeb)
  - Database firewalls

---

### 2. Operational Controls (Administrative Controls)

- **Definition**: Controls implemented primarily through human actions.
- **Examples**:
  - Training programs for staff
  - Employing security personnel (security guards)

---

### 3. Management Controls

- **Definition**: High-level controls providing an overview of security strategies.
- **Components**:
  - Regulations
  - Procedures
  - Documentation
- **Purpose**: Assist in risk assessment.

## Types of Security Controls

### 1. Preventative Controls

- **Purpose**: Reduce risk by enforcing policies.
- **Examples**:
  - Firewall policies
  - Antivirus signatures

### 2. Detective Controls

- **Purpose**: Alerts to an attack without stopping it.

### 3. Corrective Controls

- **Purpose**: Restore business operations post-attack.
- **Components**:
  - Backup and restoration processes
  - Patching of vulnerabilities

### 4. Physical Controls

- **Description**: Direct measures to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Examples**:
  - Locks
  - Doors
  - Fences

### 5. Deterrent Controls

- **Purpose**: Prevent attacks by discouraging them.
- **Examples**:
  - Warning signs
  - Security personnel
  - CCTV cameras (can also serve as detective controls)

### 6. Compensating Controls

- **Definition**: Substitutes that complement main controls when they cannot be implemented.
- **Considerations**:
  - Potentially expensive
  - May have specific technical or business requirements
  - Must be thoroughly documented and approved due to being non-standard.

## Evaluating Security Controls

### Quality Control

- **Focus**: Assess product expectations through manufacturers.

### Software Verification and Validation

- **Verification**: Compliance testing to determine if the software/hardware meets design requirements.
- **Validation**: Assessing whether the product performs as intended in a specific environment.

### Assessments

- **Definition**: Subjecting products to a checklist of requirements.

### Evaluations

- **Characteristics**: Subjective assessments of a control's usefulness and ongoing monitoring.

### Security Audits

- **Nature**: Formal and structured; validates compliance with standards.

---

## Monitoring

- **Overview**: Continuous Security Monitoring or Continuous Systems Monitoring (CSM).
- **Goals**:
  - Ongoing risk assessment and tracking potential security incidents.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Network traffic
  - Communications
  - Hosts
  - Endpoints
  - Data integrity issues
- **Challenges**: Can be costly and time-consuming.
